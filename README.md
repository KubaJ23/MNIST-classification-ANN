# MNIST-classification-ANN
My own classification ANN written completely from scratch using Java. After training, it can achieve an accuracy of around 99% (correctly classify images of digits).

To run the training process yourself, unzip the MNIST dataset and run the java program.

Once running, the program will automatically train the model on the data and after each epoch automatically test the model and output the accuracy for the given epoch.

## Example for a random training run of the program:
